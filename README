forever -> only for running the script continuously

installation instructions:
(these are for FreeBSD but should be easily adaptable to other unixoid OSes)

compile it 
# make install clean

2. install Node Package Manager from www.npmjs.org
the easiest ways is
# curl http://npmjs.org/install.sh | sh

3. install the needed Node.js packages

# npm install mime
# npm install url
# npm install forever

4. move piratebox.js and its folders to where you want it
go the the folder you extracted it and
# mkdir /var/piratebox
# mv * /var/piratebox

5. configure the piratebox script to use the folders you have chosen
open the piratebox.js in your favorite plaintext editor and change the values of
"pbUPLOADDIRECTORY" and "pbWEBROOT" to the folders you created.

6. now you can start the piratebox
to start it normal
